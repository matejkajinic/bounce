# 3D Bouncing Balls Simulation

Created by: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (AI Assistant)
Date: August 1, 2024

## Overview

This project is a simple 3D simulation of balls bouncing inside a cube, created using Three.js. It demonstrates basic 3D graphics and physics concepts in an interactive web environment.

## Features

- 3D wireframe cube representing the boundary
- Colorful bouncing balls with random colors
- User controls:
  - Slider to adjust the number of balls (1-20)
  - "Bounce" button to give all balls new random velocities
- Automatic rotation of the cube to showcase the 3D perspective

## Technical Details

- Built with Three.js (r128)
- Uses WebGL for rendering
- Responsive design that adjusts to window size

## How to Use

1. Open the HTML file in a modern web browser.
2. Use the slider to adjust the number of balls in the simulation.
3. Click the "Bounce" button to randomize the velocities of all balls.
4. Observe the balls bouncing within the rotating wireframe cube.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser with WebGL support
- Internet connection (to load the Three.js library from CDN)

## Limitations

- This is a basic simulation and does not include advanced physics like gravity or friction.
- The cube size is fixed and cannot be adjusted in the current version.
- Interaction is limited to changing the number of balls and triggering bounces.

## Future Improvements

- Add gravity and more realistic physics
- Implement user controls for cube size and gravity
- Add collision detection between balls
- Improve the visual design with more advanced Three.js features
